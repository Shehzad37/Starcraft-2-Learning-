# Starcraft-2-Learning(PySC2)
Different Reinforcement + Deep Learning techniques applied on starcraft 2 maps using PySC2 Environment.



# SC2-Q-learning
This is an implementation of the Q-Learning algorithm in SC2 environments. The algorithm learns to reach a goal state with stochastic transitions and rewards, without requiring adaptations.

# Usage
* All the hyperparameters are contained in the Learning/Q_Learning.py file.
* To train a new network runScript.py


# Requirements
* Python 3.6
* Pandas
* StartCraft II(Game)
